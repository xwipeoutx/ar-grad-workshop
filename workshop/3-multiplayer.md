# Multiplayer

By the end of this part, you will be growing plants with friends

## High level approach

We need 2 things for multiplayer: A shared idea of space, and a shared idea of game state.

We will agree on state using CODE.

We will agree on space using an image target as an anchor.

## 1. Connect to a room

<details>
    <summary>TODO</summary>

TODO

</details>

## 2. Sync plant creation and growth

<details>
    <summary>TODO</summary>

TODO

</details>

## 3. Make space relative to target

<details>
    <summary>TODO</summary>

TODO

</details>

## 4. Share other players' state

<details>
    <summary>TODO</summary>

TODO

</details>

## 5. Test it
