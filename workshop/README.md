# Workshop contents

## What are we building?

We will be transforming your office into a garden. Place flowers and plants down, and watch them grow.

Stretch goal: Share your garden with your friends in real time and space

## Learning objectives

A bunch of things to get you vaguely familiar with some 3D and AR concepts

1. 3D scenes and objects
2. Stylizing your objects for shininess and performance
3. Placing virtual objects in the real world
4. Interacting with these objects

And some stretch goals for the motivated

1. Image tracking - sharing a space
2. Multiplayer

### What if I'm a designer?

This workshop is mostly designed for development, but most of the concepts here would be great for designers to get involved in.  Work with another developer

For example

* 3d artwork and interaction
* User interface design
* Logos / splash screen / etc.
* VFX

## Prequisites

### Technical

* Have the deployed app successfully running on your AR device
  * Follow the instructions in [the base readme](../README.md)
  * If you can't get this done, at LEAST have it running in the editor (press the play button).  Downside is you'll only learn Unity concepts, not AR concepts

### Bring on the day

* Print out of the [image marker](../useful-assets/image-target.png) - black and white, 19.3 x 19.3 cm (at least 1 to share)
* To snacks and lunch, or you'll be hungry
* If you want some nice visuals, find some 3D assets to place around the room - flowers, pot-plants etc.
  * [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/)
  * [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models)
  * [Free3D](https://free3d.com/)
* Your laptop charger (you will run out of battery running Unity)
* A mouse  (3d without a mouse = paaain)
